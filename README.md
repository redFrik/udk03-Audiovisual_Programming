Olofsson: Audiovisual programming

In this course we write our own small and simple computer programs to generate and control sound and graphics. We will be programming in languages like SuperCollider, MaxMSPJitter and Processing and also extend beyond the computer using the Arduino hardware platform. By interconnecting programs, adding realtime control, playing with audiovisual mappings and feedback, our minimal programs will start generating complex and interesting results. The course ends with a public demonstration of some of the audiovisual systems we have built during the course.
